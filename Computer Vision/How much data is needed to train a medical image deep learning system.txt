Paper title: How much data is needed to train a medical image deep learning system


Summary:
The paper describes a curve approach for amount of data required for achieving high accuracy.
The approach used in learning curve approach. 
The work claim such an analysis is pending in medical domain.
Also the work follows power law where parameter are identified by weighed regression function

Contrbution:
An approach for selecting amount of dataset for medical image classification, with power law where the variance handling is done through power law.

Novel elements:
Application of said approach for medical image analysis using googlenet

Failures:
Even though the method validates for medical image analysis,sadly dataset is not available.
Secondly the paper suggests that best method of figeura et al 2012 by stating some factor on thorough evaluation, but no information on what thorough information means?




Notations: Nothing new, easy to follow

Possible explorations/Open Questions:
Adaptation to multiple other datasets and test validity of said approach.


Things learnt:
Hebbian principle
inverse power law according to figuera et al.
inconsistent variance handled through weight least scores
